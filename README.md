# Member List Change Tracker

This project is designed to analyze changes in member lists across six teams and identify potential inconsistencies, such as the same member being listed under multiple teams. It is particularly suited for scenarios where team member lists are frequently updated and cross-referenced for accuracy.

**Disclaimer**  
The example data provided in this repository is completely fictional and was generated using random data generation techniques. This data is not related to any real individuals or organizations.

## Features
- **Track Additions and Removals**: Compares two Excel files (before and after versions) to identify members added or removed from each team.
- **Detect Overlaps**: Highlights members appearing in multiple teams to resolve potential conflicts.
- **Format Standardization**: Ensures phone numbers are standardized for easier reading and comparison.

## How It Works
1. **Input Files**: The script takes two Excel files as input:
   - `file_before.xlsx`: The member list before changes.
   - `file_after.xlsx`: The member list after changes.
2. **Comparison**: For each team (represented as sheets in the Excel files):
   - Members added or removed are identified.
   - Results are formatted with name and phone number.
3. **Conflict Detection**: Identifies members appearing in multiple teams and lists the associated teams.
4. **Output**: Prints the results in a structured format for easy review.

## Sample Data
The project uses sample data for demonstration purposes:
- **Names**: Randomly generated using dictionaries of foreign first and last names.
- **Phone Numbers**: Randomly generated in Turkey's phone number format (e.g., +90 XXX XXX XX XX).

### Example Excel Files
Two example Excel files (`file_before.xlsx` and `file_after.xlsx`) are included to demonstrate the script's functionality. These files do not contain real data.

## Script
The script responsible for this functionality is `analyzer`. It is written in Python and utilizes the following libraries:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `openpyxl`: For reading and writing Excel files.

## Data Anonymization Script
To ensure no real personal data is used, a separate script named `anonymize_data.py` is provided. This script:
- Replaces names with randomly generated foreign names.
- Generates Turkish-format phone numbers randomly.
- Outputs the anonymized data into a new Excel file, preserving the structure of the original file.

### How to Use the Anonymization Script
1. Place your original Excel file in the project directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python anonymize_data.py
   ```
3. The output file will be saved as a new Excel file (e.g., `anonymized_file.xlsx`).

## Example Output
Below is a sample output generated by `analyzer.py`:
